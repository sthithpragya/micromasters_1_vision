function G = gausspyr(I,depth)

    % Input:
    % I: the input image
    % depth: number of levels of the Gaussian pyramid
    % Output:
    % G: a cell containing all the levels of the Gaussian pyramid
    
    % Please follow the instructions to fill in the missing commands.
    
    G = cell(1,depth);
    
    % 1) Create a pyramid, where the first level is the original image
    % and every subsequent level is the reduced version of the previous level
    for i = 1:depth
        if i == 1
            G{i} = % original image
        else
            G{i} = % reduced version of the previous level
